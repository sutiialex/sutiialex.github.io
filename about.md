Hey, hey, welcome! I am Alex, from Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I spend
much of my day desiging and writing code. In my evenings
I cook, do theater and Improv. I reach many of my vacation destinations
by motorbike. When I feel bad about burning gasoline, I cycle or sail.

I hope you're enjoying this blog!
